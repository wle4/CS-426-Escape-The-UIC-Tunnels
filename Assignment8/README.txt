We created an intro scene and credit scene to go along with the flow of the game. Doing this will create a feel for a beginning and end state. The intro scene includes the title and an introduction story of the student. The introduction story has the student named Nikko try to find a place to study for his exam tomorrow, and stumbles across what he believes is a shortcut to his destination study spot. This is where he then enters the game, and stumbled upon the UIC tunnels! The credit scene includes the names of the creators (Whitney, Stephen, Irvi) and indicating that this is a UIC CS 426 project. Shaders are also added to the game, included modified lighting (making it brighter for the user to experience better looking graphics) and shaders materials to certain objects in the game.
