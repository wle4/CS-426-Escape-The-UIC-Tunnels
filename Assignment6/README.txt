Assignment 6
Three Examples of Physics:
    1. Grabbable boxes for makeshift staircases.
    2. Longer grabbable objects for players to grab and cross death pits.
    3. Invisible barriers and colliders.
    Rationale: The player will come across so many obstacles, and it is up to them to be able to solve how to survive each one.
        We forgot to mention in the video, but we did use invisible barriers/colliders, and that's so that players are encouraged to
        speak to NPC's more, and forced to in some cases since we expect NPC's to be important to the overall plot and gameplay.
Three Lights
    1. White bright ceiling lights
    2. Yellow less bright ceiling lights
    3. Red dim emergency lights
    Rationale: Our game is a horror game, meaning that lighting is crucial for enabling a scary environment.
        These colors and their different levels of brightness enhances that feeling of horror as you explore through the tunnels.
Three Textures
    1. Cement floor
    2. Red brick walls
    3. Black brick-patterned ceiling
    Rationale: We felt that these three textures are the most accurate to what we would think of abandoned tunnels under UIC.
    The materials themselves had a darker tone to them as well, which helps with setting a scary atmosphere.
Three of the AI Techniques
    1. Pathfinding - NPC utilizes a waypoint graph to wander back and forth between points
    2. FSM - Before the bridge, a barrier will block the player from entering and give him a warning saying "Maybe I should talk to that guy..." until he talks to the NPC.
        The barrier is only taken down once the player talks to the NPC.
    3. FSM - Bridge collapses when the player begins to cross the bridge.
    Rationale: The game revolves around the player's actions with how they interact with several obstacles and especially NPC's.
        Different actions will change the player's survival in several ways, similar to how it would feel in real life.
Three Examples of Mecanim (all player animations):
    1. Idle (slightly swinging arms and body)
    2. Walking
    3. Running
    Rationale: These are the basis of movement for the player's character, and such, animations for them are necessary for making the game feel well done.
