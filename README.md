Our Design is that you are a UIC Student who stumbled upon the underground tunnels of UIC and must pass through the tunnels to get through the other side. The components are 3D physics
on wooden boxes and bridges. There are three lights used in the demo such as ceiling lights, lights on the rooms, and lights on the side walls. The three textures are on the floor, the ceiling,
and the boxes. The pathfinding we used is when the player doesnt interact with the NPC, the player will be stopped by an invisible wall and cannot proceed unless they interact with the NPC.
A traditional puzzle we put was using a long wooden box and putting it over a broken bridge in order for the player to cross the bridge. The first use of Mecanim is the NPC movement. The second
use of Mecanim is the player being idle. The third use of Mecanim is the player sprint animation.
